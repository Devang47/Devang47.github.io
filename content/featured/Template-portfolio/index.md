This is a template portfolio website built using Threejs, inspired from [ilithya](https://www.ilithya.rocks/). In this project I worked with [TextGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=tex#examples/en/geometries/TextGeometry) and [Points](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=poin#api/en/objects/Points) in Three.js and optimized the website using the best practices.
